            <li>Dependability</li>
            <p>Being there through thick and thin. This is not just being present and correct. It’s about being consistently available for our kids through good times and bad.</p>
            <li>Involvement</li>
            <p>Being personally engaged in our kids’ lives, interests, hopes and dreams on a daily basis. Being curious and attentive requires us to put our distractions to one side.</p>
            <li>Compassion</li>
            <p>Showing compassion, hope and belief when our child needs it most. Compassion is a state of mind or attitude that really helps us to feel connected and close to the human experience of being a child.</p>
            <li>Valuing of mother</li>
            <p>Showing respect and love of our kids’ mother. This isn’t about just always agreeing with mum! Valuing is similar to validating our partner for who they are with all their imperfections. Showing love and respect requires action, not just thoughts, and teaches our sons and daughters how to be treated.</p>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <p>Listening empathically in order to be understanding, present and engaged. Putting ourselves into the shoes of others enables them to feel heard, respected and valued. Even if we don’t completely get it, or even like it</p>
            <li>Being verbally expressive</li>
            <p>To clearly communicate, uphold guidelines, being tough yet fair, without belittling or being controlling.</p>
            <li>Being human</li>
            To own mistakes, be open to feedback, and teach that growth is a lifelong endeavour. So, dad (and mum) get it wrong, sometimes! I reckon teaching our kids to be human means we have to show our own humanity, as often as possible.
